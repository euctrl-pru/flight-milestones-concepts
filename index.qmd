This document details the concepts and ideas supporting the definition of flight milestones.

# Phases of a Flight

In a flight we can identify _events_ that can help to monitor its evolution from a gate-to-gate
perspective.
@fig-flight-phases shows a simplified diagram of a possible set of flight phases (white square boxes) and relevant events (`Txy` labels).

![Flight phases and events.](media/flight_states.png){#fig-flight-phases}

In general we are interested in analyzing performance at gate-to-gate level so
as to cover both the airborne and the ground phases of flights. To this extent
we summarize a flight down to some of its fundamental milestones as in the
following list (from departure to arrival):

(@) Off-block (**T06**)
(@) End of push back (**T07**)
(@) Enter runway for take-off (**T09**)
(@) Lift-off (**T12**), a.k.a. take-off
(@) 40-nautical-miles intersection (**T14** ?)
(@) top-of-climb (**T15**)
(@) top-of-descent (**T18**)
(@) 40-nautical-miles intersection (**T19** ?)
(@) Touch-down (**T22**)
(@) Runway vacated (**T24**)
(@) Enter parking spot (**T26**)
(@) on-block (**T27**)


Other interesting milestones could be

(@) Holding start
(@) Holding end
(@) Leveled segment start
(@) Leveled segment end
(@) FIR crossing


Subsets of these milestones allow for the calculation of taxi-in (`T24`, `T27`) and
taxi-out (`T06`, `T09`) times, runway utilization and
sequencing (`T12`, `T22`), inefficiencies in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMS) (via
holding patterns and leveled portions of the descent)  ...
Additional ad-hoc milestones can be defined for specific needs, for example FIR crossing
milestones would be usefult to count Departure, Arrival, Internal, Overflight (DAIO) statistics.


# Milestone

A flight milestone is conceptually defined by

* flight ID it belongs to
* 3D location (decimal degrees of longitude, latitude [in WSG84] and altitude [in feet]), i.e. 
  `17.933996,59.653410,-203`
* UTC timestamp, i.e. `2021-09-27 10:43:11.234 UTC`
* milestone type, i.e. `top-of-climb` or `off-block`

Further useful attributes for business processing of the information are:

* the source of extraction of the milestone, i.e. `apdf` (when data provided by airport),
  `osn` (extracted by OSN's ADS-B data), `nm` (as calculated by EUROCONTROL's Network Manager)
* contextual information, i.e. `F33R` as the relevant parking position for an `off-block` milestone
  or `26` as the runway ID for a `take-off` milestone.


# Use Cases

A milestone-based representation of a flight is a way to reduce complexity
for its representation and hence allow some (still useful) statistical analysis for
performance monitoring.

## Fuel consumption / Environmental emissions

Environmental emissions and climate impact are indicators more and more in news headlines and
on the political agendas.
With a milestone-based representation of a flight we can *segment* the phases of interest
and calculated the relevant cumulative emissions.

For example we can split a flight in the following phases:

* cruise
* landing and takeoff (LTO)

and calculate the fuel-burnt emissions by further splitting them.

![LTO phases ([@doi/10.2822/385503] Figure 2.5).](media/lto-cycle_eea.png)

For LTO we have four sub-phases:

* approach
* taxi-in
* taxi-out
* take-off
* climb-out

For example taxi-out sub-phase can be framed by the ground portion from `off-block` to
`rwy-entry` milestones which with defined assumptions in term of aircraft & engine type,
full thrust percentage and number of engines in use can be handled to an emission calculator
to compute CO2, NOx, ... emissions.

The selection of milestones to model the flight and the further assumptions of how the aircraft
is operated between those milestones will produce results with different levels of
[accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision).


## Operational performance

A milestone-based modelling of a flight provides practical ways to extract operational
indicators for the analysis of the operation performance at network, state, airport or
airline level.

For example using the `touch-down` (**T22** in @fig-flight-phases) with the contextual information
we can calculate RWY utilization at each airport or inter-arrival times, etc.


# Milestones Definition

DEFINE ER diagram: 

* flight table --> at a min flight ID, ADEP, ADES, take-off, touch-down (optionally or in a
  separate table aircraft info, airline info) 
* state vector (or point profile or similar) --> with ideally sk to flight ID on flight table
* milestone table --> with sk to flight ID on flight table
* (optional in a normalized DB schema) contextual info table --> sk to flight ID in flight table
