    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis document details the concepts and ideas supporting the definition of flight milestones.\nIn a flight we can identify events that can help to monitor its evolution from a gate-to-gate perspective. Figure 2.1 shows a simplified diagram of a possible set of flight phases (white square boxes) and relevant events (Txy labels).\nIn general we are interested in analyzing performance at gate-to-gate level so as to cover both the airborne and the ground phases of flights. To this extent we summarize a flight down to some of its fundamental milestones as in the following list (from departure to arrival):\nOther interesting milestones could be\nSubsets of these milestones allow for the calculation of taxi-in (T24, T27) and taxi-out (T06, T09) times, runway utilization and sequencing (T12, T22), inefficiencies in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMS) (via holding patterns and leveled portions of the descent) … Additional ad-hoc milestones can be defined for specific needs, for example FIR crossing milestones would be usefult to count Departure, Arrival, Internal, Overflight (DAIO) statistics.\nA flight milestone is conceptually defined by\nFurther useful attributes for business processing of the information are:\nA milestone-based representation of a flight is a way to reduce complexity for its representation and hence allow some (still useful) statistical analysis for performance monitoring.\nThe milestone concept can be modeled in entity-relationship fashion as in Figure 5.1.\nIn words, a milestone refers to a flight (via the foreign key flight_id) and has few attributes as described in Chapter 3 (namely, type, timestamp, lon, lat, alt, src, info.)\nA flight is (simply) defined by the aerodrome of departure (ADEP) and destination (ADES) (which are are foreign keys to AIRPORT.id), its callsign, take-off and landing timestamps, and aircraft (a foreign key to AIRCRAFT.id.) [NOTE: this is still simplistic…how do we cater for AFIL, ZZZZ (these could be just special airport entries without lon/lat/elevation) or crashes (again another special entry?)]\nA flight (point) profile is a 4D sequence of timestamp and 3D positions as flown (or calculated). A flight profiles links to the relevant flight via the foreign key flight_id.\nFor OSN a flight profile is a state vector."

    "text": "4.1 Fuel consumption / Environmental emissions\nEnvironmental emissions and climate impact are indicators more and more in news headlines and on the political agendas. With a milestone-based representation of a flight we can segment the phases of interest and calculated the relevant cumulative emissions.\nFor example we can split a flight in the following phases:\n\ncruise\nlanding and takeoff (LTO)\n\nand calculate the fuel-burnt emissions by further splitting them.\n\n\n\nLTO phases ([1] Figure 2.5).\n\n\nFor LTO we have four sub-phases:\n\napproach\ntaxi-in\ntaxi-out\ntake-off\nclimb-out\n\nFor example taxi-out sub-phase can be framed by the ground portion from off-block to rwy-entry milestones which with defined assumptions in term of aircraft & engine type, full thrust percentage and number of engines in use can be handled to an emission calculator to compute CO2, NOx, … emissions.\nThe selection of milestones to model the flight and the further assumptions of how the aircraft is operated between those milestones will produce results with different levels of accuracy and precision."

For example we could have AUA crossing (x-aua) or even elementary airspace (x-esa) ones. The tricky thing is obviously having a non-overlapping airspaces (of the same type)"
