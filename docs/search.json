    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis document details the concepts and ideas supporting the definition of flight milestones.\nIn a flight we can identify events that can help to monitor its evolution from a gate-to-gate perspective. Figure 2.1 shows a simplified diagram of a possible set of flight phases (white square boxes) and relevant events (Txy labels).\nIn general we are interested in analyzing performance at gate-to-gate level so as to cover both the airborne and the ground phases of flights. To this extent we summarize a flight down to some of its fundamental milestones as in the following list (from departure to arrival):\nOther interesting milestones could be\nSubsets of these milestones allow for the calculation of taxi-in (T24, T27) and taxi-out (T06, T09) times, runway utilization and sequencing (T12, T22), inefficiencies in the Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) (via holding patterns and leveled portions of the descent) … Additional ad-hoc milestones can be defined for specific needs, for example Flight Information Region (FIR) crossing milestones would be usefult to count Departure, Arrival, Internal, Overflight (DAIO) statistics.\nA flight milestone is conceptually defined by\nFurther useful attributes for business processing of the information are:\nA milestone-based representation of a flight is a way to reduce complexity for its representation and hence allow some (still useful) statistical analysis for performance monitoring.\nThe milestone concept can be modeled in entity-relationship fashion as in Figure 5.2.\nerDiagram\n    MILESTONE {\n        int id PK\n        int flight_id FK\n        string type\n        datetime timestamp\n        float longitude\n        float latitude\n        float altitude\n        string source\n        string info\n    }\n    FLIGHT {\n        int id PK\n        int ADEP FK\n        int ADES FK\n        int aircraft FK\n        string FLT_ID\n    }\n    OA_AIRPORTS {\n        int id PK\n        string ident\n        string type\n        string name\n        double latitude_deg\n        double longitude_deg\n        int elevation_ft\n        string continent\n        string iso_country\n        string iso_region\n        string municipality\n        string scheduled_service\n        string gps_code\n        string iata_code\n        string local_code\n        string home_link\n        string wikipedia_link\n        string keywords\n    }\n    OA_RUNWAYS {\n        int id PK\n        int airport_ref FK\n        string airport_ident\n        int length_ft\n        int width_ft\n        string surface\n        boolean lighted\n        boolean closed\n        string le_ident\n        double le_latitude_deg\n        double le_longitude_deg\n        int le_elevation_ft\n        double le_heading_degt\n        int le_displaced_threshold_ft\n        string he_ident\n        double he_latitude_deg\n        double he_longitude_deg\n        int he_elevation_ft\n        double he_heading_degt\n        int he_displaced_threshold_ft\n    }\n    AIRCRAFT {\n        int id PK\n        int icao24\n    }\n    PROFILE {\n        int id PK\n    }\n    \n    MILESTONE }|--|| FLIGHT : has\n    FLIGHT    }o--|{ OA_AIRPORTS : has\n    OA_AIRPORTS   }|--|{ OA_RUNWAYS : has\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Entity-Relationship diagram for Milestone and relevant concepts.\nIn words, a milestone refers to a flight (via the foreign key flight_id) and has few attributes as described in Chapter 3 (namely, type, timestamp, lon, lat, alt, src, info.)\nA flight is (simply) defined by the aerodrome of departure (ADEP) and destination (ADES) (which are are foreign keys to AIRPORT.id), its callsign, take-off and landing timestamps, and aircraft (a foreign key to AIRCRAFT.id.) [NOTE: this is still simplistic…how do we cater for AFIL, ZZZZ (these could be just special airport entries without lon/lat/elevation) or crashes (again another special entry?)]\nA flight (point) profile is a 4D sequence of timestamp and 3D positions as flown (or calculated). A flight profiles links to the relevant flight via the foreign key flight_id.\nFor OSN a flight profile is a state vector."

With a milestone-based representation of a flight we can segment the phases of interest and calculated the relevant cumulative emissions.\nFor example we can split a flight in the following phases:\n\ncruise\nLanding and TakeOff (LTO) cycle\n\nand calculate the fuel-burnt emissions by further splitting them.\n\n\n\nLTO phases ([1] Figure 2.5).\n\n\nFor LTO we have four sub-phases:\n\napproach\ntaxi-in\ntaxi-out\ntake-off\nclimb-out\n\nFor example taxi-out sub-phase can be framed by the ground portion from off-block to rwy-entry milestones which with defined assumptions in term of aircraft & engine type, full thrust percentage and number of engines in use can be handled to an emission calculator to compute CO2, NOx, … emissions.\nThe selection of milestones to model the flight and the further assumptions of how the aircraft is operated between those milestones will produce results with different levels of accuracy and precision.\nNOTE: add ER diagram for use case"
